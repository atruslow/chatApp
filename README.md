# Chat App

## Overview

This is an app I created when I was messing around with Node.js. Nothing spectacular, but it is a chat application using websockets. 

## Set Up

Pull the repo, and run the following commands in the root directory of the repo:

	npm install

	node server.js

You can access this by going to localhost:3000 in your browser.
